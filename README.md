# TranscriptAnalyzer
Angular project

Transcript Analyzer allows sales and support team managers to get insights on the quality of the outbound calls to customers that the members on their team make day-in and day-out Transcript Analyzer enables managers to easily do this by showing a side-by-side comparison between the transcript of the real call the agent made and the intended call script for that specific type of call Transcript Analyzer highlights the sentence on both panels where the sentence has a "similarity" above or equal to the selected “Matching Sensitivity” value. The main assumption is that better agents will stick to the script and cover more of it.


No server side as all data is mocked. Purely a frontend project.
